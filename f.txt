The String class represents character strings. All string literals in Java programs, such as "abc", are implemented as instances of this class. Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they are created. The class String includes methods for examining individual characters of the sequence, for comparing strings, for searching strings, for extracting substrings, and for creating a copy of a string with all characters translated to uppercase or to lowercase. Case mapping is based on the Unicode Standard version specified by the Character class.
